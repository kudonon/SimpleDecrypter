This is a simple Decryption Program.

The program is used to Decrypt words/sentences in which each 
letter been shifted up by an arbitrary number of letters.

For example:
HELLO -> QDOSH

The decrypter basically lists every combination of word that 
the encryption could mean and also provides the number of
computations done for it.

It doesn't use any complex algorithm, but can be extended to 
find common words and be more useful/efficient in the future.
